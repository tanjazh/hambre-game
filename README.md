- Why did you undertake it?

> This project is a card game called Hambre built with React and TypeScript, developed as a hands-on way to solidify my skills in frontend development. 
>
>After completing several bootcamps, I wanted to create something engaging that would challenge me to apply everything I learned—from component architecture and state management to TypeScript’s strong typing. The goal of this project was not only to build a fun, interactive game but also to reinforce my understanding of modern frontend practices and best coding standards in a real-world setting.

## Playing
Mix over 30 ingredients to create unique 4-card combos in this fast-paced game of cards. Compete using random ingredients, and score as many points as possible before the main deck runs out of cards!

How to play

Hambre presents a simple mechanic of drawing a card and playing a card.

Each time it is your turn, you will get a new random ingredient card.
Each player has two boards that store up to 4 cards each (refrigerator and table).
Each time a player collects 4 cards on a board, he will have created a combo. Add up the points for each card and add them to your score sheet.
Finally remove the cards from the game and keep cooking combos until you run out of ingredients.
If you manage to collect 4 cards from the same menu (same color) the points are doubled.
